We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called \"tracking pixels\" or \"clear gifs\"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.\n                </Typography.Paragraph>\n\n                <Typography.Title level={3}>\n                    Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?\n                </Typography.Title>\n\n\n                <Typography.Paragraph>\n                    Websites may also use so-called \"Flash Cookies\" (also known as Local Shared Objects or \"LSOs\") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.\n                </Typography.Paragraph>\n\n                <Typography.Paragraph>\n                    If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel.
